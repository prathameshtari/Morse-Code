# Morse Code Computer Vision


This project translates morse code in plain english. We used webcam to read blinking of the eyes as dots and dashes which then with the use of a dictionary converts morse to english.

File `morse_converter.py` contains the python dictionary. For reference we have also included the Poster Cards to learn Morse better.

`Short Blink : Dot ' . '`

`Long Blink : Dash ' - '`

`Long Long Blink : Removes the last dot or dash`
